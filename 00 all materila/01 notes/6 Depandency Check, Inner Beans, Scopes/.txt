In this lecture he will mandate the dependency injection and do a dependency check by using the at required annotation from spring.

the usecase that wIll be working on is a patient prescription use case you will create a prescription
class a spring bean which will have an ID patient name and the list of medicines and will see how

note: 

1. if perticular field is mandatory in bean class to used so for this we use @Required annotation in setter method and also import perticular class
2. after that enable the use of annotation in xml comfig file by using this
						<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.RequiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor" />


note: 
now there are 4 ways to inject an object
1. using refrence as object
2. using refrence as attribute
3. using p schemas
4. using inner beans

		Spring Been Scopes ----
___________________________________________

In this lecture you will learn about the spring beans scopes.

The scope is availability of the object in the container in simple words,
it is the number of objects created in the container of a particular bean type.

There are five possible values
1. Singleton
2. prototype
3. request
4. session
5. globalsession. 


1. Singleton
Singleton is the default value when we configure a bean in the spring configuration, and we do not provide any scope, by default it is singleton.The spring container if the marked a singleton or if we don't specify anything on the bean will create only one object no matter how many times that bean is read and used in our application.

2. Prototype
The second scope is the prototype scope. If we mark bean as prototype then the container will create different objects of that type. 
Every time that object is read and used in our application 

3. request
request as the name itself says the request scope is only relevant for spring MVC webapplications, when the request comes in from the end user
or from the browser to our web application which is developed using spring, spring container will create an object per user request next session again.


4. Session
Session is also relevant only for spring MVCweb applications.
A session is everything that happens between a user login and Logout or everything that happens from the
time the user first access our website till the time he leaves our website if we mark a bean as session scope scope 
then the spring container will create only one object for the entire session. If a new user session is created then another object will be instantiated by spring.

5. global session,
this will create if we mark Bean as Global's session scoped, Spring container will create an objectper global context.
This is used only in spring. MVC Portlet applications.
In Portlet applications there can be multiple Portlets across these portlets there will be a global session. 
global context and Spring container will create only one object for the entire global session
across these portlets




---------------   Overview   ------------------
1. Dependency check
	We use @Required otherwise it thorw BeanInitializationException

2. InnerBean
	<bean>
		<property>
			<bean>
			
3. Scopes 
Last and very important you have learnt the five different scopes namely 
	Singleton 
	prototype 
	request
	session and 
	globalsession 
that apply to spring beans.



note : 
ques : Which XML element can be used to enable annotation support in spring
ans : context:annotation-config

note : each bean inside beans we tells, it create the object of perticular class.
