In this lecture, you will learn what constructor injection and start using it.


Spring supports creating objects using parameterized constructs.

1.
<constructor-arg>
	<value> b </value> ( we can either pass primitive types as value, we can pass collections using list, set etc. ) 
<constructor-arg>

2. And also you can pass reference types using the ref element. Both these elements value and ref can be used 
as elements, as attributes and also you can use something called C schema or C namespace. This is very similar to P schema or namespace which you have used in property injection.

<constructor-arg>
	<ref bean="a" /> 
<constructor-arg>

example : 

public class Employee {
	private int id;
	private Address address;
	
	
	Employee(int id, Address address){
		this.id = id;
		this.address = address;
	}

1. used as element

	<bean class="com.bharath.spring.springcore.constructorinjection.Employee" name="employee" >
		<constructor-arg>
			<value>123</value>
		</constructor-arg>
		
		<constructor-arg>
			<ref bean="address"></ref>
		</constructor-arg>
	</bean>



2. used as attribute

	<bean class="com.bharath.spring.springcore.constructorinjection.Employee" name="employee" >
		<constructor-arg value="123" />
		<constructor-arg ref="address" />
	</bean>

3. using c schema namespace 
	before using this we have to add c-schema depandency in beans
